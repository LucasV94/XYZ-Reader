# XYZ Reader
XYZ Reader displays a list of articles that the user can read. 
As a part of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree, I redesigned the app to follow the Material Design 
guidelines and translated a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app. The app including 
support for older API versions and features animations and transitions for devices higher than Lollipop.


##Things I learned

* Understanding the fundamentals of Android design.
* Applying Material Design guidelines to a mobile application.
* Separating an interface into surfaces.
* Effectively using transitions and motion.
